Encrypt-Chat
This project includes both front-end and back-end components.
The front-end is likely the browser interface using HTML and JavaScript, handling user input and displaying chat messages.
The back-end, implemented in Python with Flask, manages encryption/decryption of messages, storage, and communication with clients.
